#' While high-dimensional single-cell based flow and mass cytometry data has
#' demonstrated increased applications in microenvironment composition and
#' stem-cell research, integrated analyzing workflow design for experimental
#' cytometry data has been challenging. Here, we present CytoTree, an R package
#' designed for the analysis and interpretation of flow and mass cytometry
#' data. We have applied CytoTree to mass cytometry and time course flow
#' cytometry data to validate the usage and practical utility of its
#' computational modules. These use cases introduce CytoTree as a reliable tool
#' for high-dimensional cytometry data workflow and reveal good performance
#' on trajectory reconstruction and pseudotime estimation.
