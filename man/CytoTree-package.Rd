While high-dimensional single-cell based flow and mass cytometry data has
demonstrated increased applications in microenvironment composition and
stem-cell research, integrated analyzing workflow design for experimental
cytometry data has been challenging. Here, we present CytoTree, an R package
designed for the analysis and interpretation of flow and mass cytometry
data. We have applied CytoTree to mass cytometry and time course flow
cytometry data to validate the usage and practical utility of its
computational modules. These use cases introduce CytoTree as a reliable tool
for high-dimensional cytometry data workflow and reveal good performance
on trajectory reconstruction and pseudotime estimation.
